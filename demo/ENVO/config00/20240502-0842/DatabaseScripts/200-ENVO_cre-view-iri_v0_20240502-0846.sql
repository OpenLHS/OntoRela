Where the direction of the shore turns inland (reenters) the longshore current spreads out or dissipates. No longer able to carry the full load, much of the sediment is dropped.

It contains almost all the water vapour and aerosols and three-quarters of the total gaseous mass of the atmosphere. Throughout the troposphere temperature decreases with height at a mean rate of 6.5°C/km and the whole zone is capped by either an inversion of temperature or an isothermal layer at the tropopause.

Its formation begins when a glacier moves over an area containing alternate bands of hard and soft bedrock. The sharp-edged boulders carried at the bottom of the glacier erode the softer rock more quickly by abrasion, thus creating a hollow called a rock basin. On either side of the rock basin, the more resistant rock is eroded less and these outcrops of harder rock are known as rock bars, which act as dams between which rainwater may accumulate after the retreat of the ice age, filling up the rock basin and creating a ribbon lake. A ribbon lake may also form behind a terminal or recessional moraine, both of which also act as dams, enabling water to accumulate behind them. A ribbon lake may also occur if a tributary glacier joins a main glacier. The increase in power can create a trough, which is filled with water from a river/meltwater to create a ribbon lake.';

COMMENT ON VIEW "ENVO_iri"."ENVO_01000099" IS 'marine surface current::A marine current bordered by the surface of the water column and the permanent thermocline, where it occurs. Surface currents are mostly wind driven and mostly limited to the top 400 m of the water column. Ocean currents are driven by the circulation of wind above surface waters. Frictional stress at the interface between the ocean and the wind causes the water to move in the direction of the wind. Large ocean currents are a response of the atmosphere and ocean to the flow of energy from the tropics to polar regions. In some cases, currents are transient features and affect only a small area. Other ocean currents are essentially permanent and extend over large horizontal distances.';

SOURCE DEFINITION: Marine brine pools are large areas of brine on the ocean basin. These pools are bodies of water that have a salinity three to five times greater than the surrounding ocean. For deep-sea brine pools the source of the salt is the dissolution of large salt deposits through salt tectonics.

TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones. A system which has the disposition to environ one or more material entities.';

TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones.';

TARGET DEFINITION: An oceanographic feature that involves wind-driven motion of dense, cooler, and usually nutrient-rich water towards the ocean surface, replacing the warmer, usually nutrient-deplete surface water.
--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones. A system which has the disposition to environ one or more material entities.';

--------------------
SOURCE DEFINITION: A marine upwelling is a net flow of marine water to the surface of the water column from deeper regions. This is often a result of surface water displacement off continental coasts by wind action. Localised upwellings may also occur along divergent fronts around eddies and along some of the major oceanographic features. Deeper waters often have higher nutrient content; consequently blooms of primary producers, such as planktonic algae, are generally observed around upwelling zones.
