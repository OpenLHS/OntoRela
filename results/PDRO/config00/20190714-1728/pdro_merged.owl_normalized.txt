Dissolved gasses, usually nitrogen and oxygen from the air, tend to be evolved in the mobile phase as the pressure is reduced when the mobile phase leaves the liquid chromatography column and enters the detector. Gasses in the mobile phase in the detector can produce completely unacceptable noise and, thus, must be removed. The dissolved gasses were originally removed under vacuum but, unfortunately, are soon replaced if the solvent is left in contact with air at atmospheric pressure. For this reason degassing is now usually carried out by bubbling helium through the mobile phase reservoirs. Secondly, vacuum is used in the thermionic detector. This consists of a device, very similar in design to the thermionic valve which is attached to a vacuum and a small quantity of the eluent from a gas chromatography column allowed to bleed through it. Helium is used as the carrier gas. The presence of solute vapor causes the thermionic current to fall. This type of detector tends to become contaminated rather readily.'

Physically the sensor appears to be very similar to the FID but, in fact, operates on an entirely different principle. The nitrogen phosphorous detector (sometimes called the thermionic detector) is a very sensitive but specific detector that responds almost exclusively to nitrogen and phosphorous compounds. It is based on the flame ionization detector but differs in that it contains a rubidium or cesium silicate (glass) bead situated in a heater coil, a little distance from the hydrogen flame. If the detector is to respond to both nitrogen and phosphorous then the hydrogen flow should be minimal so that the gas does not ignite at the jet. If the detector is to respond to phosphorous only, a large flow of hydrogen is used which is burnt at the jet. The heated bead emits electrons by thermionic emission. These electrons are collected under a potential of a few volts by an appropriately placed anode, and provides a background current. When a solute containing nitrogen or phosphorous is eluted from the column, the partially combusted nitrogen and phosphorous materials are adsorbed on the surface of the bead. The adsorbed material reduces the work function of the surface and, as consequence, the emission of electrons is increased which raises the current collected at the electrode. The sensitivity of the detector to phosphorous is about 10-12 gram per ml and for nitrogen about 10-11 gram per ml at a signal to nose ratio of 2. The alkali bead as a finite life and needs regular replacement.'

The current generated is therefore a measure of the analyte concentration. f the amount of ionization is reproducible for a given compound, pressure, and light source then the current collected at the PID%'s reaction cell electrodes is reproducibly proportional to the amount of that compound entering the cell. The reason why the compounds that are routinely analyzed are either aromatic hydrocarbons or heteroatom containing compounds (like organosulfur or organophosphorus species) is because these species have ionization potentials (IP) that are within reach of commercially available UV lamps. The available lamp energies range from 8.3 to 11.7 ev, that is, lambda max ranging from 150 nm to 106 nm. Although most PIDs have only one lamp, lamps in the PID are exchanged depending on the compound selectivity required in the analysis.'

  DESCRIPTION @en 'A sample valve that must be able to sustain pressures up to 10,000 p.s.i., although it is most likely to operate on a continuous basis, at pressures of 3,000 p.s.i. or less. The higher the operating pressure the tighter the valve seating surfaces must be forced together to eliminate any leak. It follows that any abrasive material, however fine, that passes into the valve can cause the valve seating to become scored each time it is rotated which will ultimately lead to leaks. This will cause the sample size to vary between samples and eventually affect the accuracy of the analysis. It follows that any solid material must be carefully removed from any sample before filling the valve. The sample volume of an internal loop valve is situated in the connecting slot of the valve rotor and can be used only for relatively small sample volumes. Internal sample loop valves provide samples with volumes ranging from 0.1 ml to about 0.5 ml. Valve operation is shown in figure 6. The left-hand side diagram shows the load position. The sample occupies the rotor slot and has been filled by passing the sample from an appropriate syringe through the rotor slot to waste. While loading the sample, the mobile phase supply is passed through the valve directly to the column. To place the sample onto the column, the valve is then rotated and the valve slot containing the sample is now placed between the solvent supply and the column. As a result, the sample is passed into the column by the flow of solvent.'

The results are then smoothed together to form a curve. The smoothness of loess fits is controlled by a smoothing parameter (often denoted as alpha, usually between 1/4 and 1) and the degree of the polynomial that is fitted by the method (usually denoted by lambda).'

The emitter for phosphorus compounds in the flame is excited HPO (lambda max = doublet 510-526 nm). In order to selectively detect one or the other family of compounds as it elutes from the GC column, an interference filter is used between the flame and the photomultiplier tube (PMT) to isolate the appropriate emission band.

Bruker BioSpin meets this challenge with a revolutionary NMR probe design: The 1mm MicroProbe. It operates with disposable 1mm capillary sample tubes and the sample volume of 5 microliters enables the use of lowest amounts of sample to run all high resolution NMR experiments with outstanding sensitivity and up to 16 times faster measurements. Due to the TXI-type probe design, the z-gradient coil and the automatic matching and tuning accessory, the 1mm MicroProbe can be used for a wide variety of NMR experiments. The key advantages of this probe include:\n   up to 4 times higher mass sensitivity than 5mm conventional probes (with respect to the same sample amount)\n   excellent solvent suppression properties\n   virtually no salt effect\n   discrete samples in tubes that can be sealed and stored\n   automation accessory for sample preparation and handling available.'

  DESCRIPTION @en 'Although there are many direct ozone chemiluminescent reactions with various gaseous molecules, the incorporation of a conversion step to convert various non-chemiluminescent analytes to a species capable of reacting with ozone to produce chemiluminescence broadens the horizon of this technique tremendously. The conversion of nearly all nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds to their respective chemiluminescent species for universal nitrogen and sulfur detection has made nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection the most widely used analytical methods based upon ozone-induced chemiluminescence. In addition to non-chromatographic applications, nitrogen/sulfur chemiluminescence detection has been adapted to various chromatographic techniques from gas chromatography to liquid and supercritical fluid chromatography as specialized element-specific detectors. The characteristics of these detectors are evaluated and compared to other element-selective detection techniques. The unique features of the chemiluminescence detectors have made them powerful tools in many diverse fields of analytical chemistry.'

Pulsed Electrochemical Detection (PED) allows simple, sensitive, and direct detection of numerous polar aliphatic compounds, especially carbohydrates. This technique exploits the electrocatalytic activity of noble metal electrode surfaces to oxidize various polar functional groups. In PED, multi-step potential-time waveforms at Au and Pt electrodes realize amperometric/coulometric detection while maintaining uniform and reproducible electrode activity. The response mechanisms in PED are dominated by the surface properties of the electrode, and, as a consequence, members of each chemical class of compounds produce virtually identical voltammetric responses. Thus, the full potential is realized when combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).'

On receiving a signal from the microprocessor, the next vial is placed under the column outlet and the eluate collected until receiving another signal from the computer. Once the properties of the chromatogram that describes the separation has been ascertained, then the collection program can be defined. The fractions can be collected on a basis of time either at regular intervals or a specific times to collect specific peaks. Alternatively the fractions can be collected by monitoring the detector output and when a peak starts to elute the fraction collector is activated and the peak collected in a specific vial. When the peak returns to base line the column eluate is then directed to waste until the next peak starts eluting. Fraction collectors are in common use with most liquid chromatographs.

The ever increasing need to measure lower sample amounts and lower level impurities demands the highest NMR sensitivity. Traditional LC-NMR systems with relatively large peak volumes are not optimized for such low levels of detection. Bruker BioSpin, together with Waters and Protasis has developed a Capillary LC-NMR system. The latest capillary LC attributes and highest capillary flow probe sensitivity combine with state of the art NMR systems technology. Greater mass sensitivity and faster spectral analysis with smaller sample volumes is possible.

The most common form of the algorithm starts by partitioning the input points into k initial sets, either at random or using some heuristic data. It then calculates the mean point, or centroid, of each set. It constructs a new partition by associating each point with the closest centroid. Then the centroids are recalculated for the new clusters, and the algorithm repeated by alternate applications of these two steps until convergence, which is obtained when the points no longer switch clusters (or alternatively centroids are no longer changed).'

This so-called Magic Angle Gradient is employed in Brukers high resolution Magic Angle Spinning (hr-MAS) probes, and is implemented in such a way that it is compatible with the stator and does not interfere with the sample eject or insert. Bruker BioSpin has developed a series of dedicated probes for standard bore magnets to accommodate the rapidly expanding field of hr-MAS. These probes are available in double (e.g. 1H and 13C) and triple resonance (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) modes and come equipped with a deuterium lock channel. The probes have automatic sample ejection and insertion capability, with the availability of an optional sample changer, enabling fully automated sample runs. Probes can be equipped with an optional B0 gradient, directed along the magic angle, so that gradient spectroscopy can be done used.'

The position of the peak along the time axis of the chart measures the component%'s retention time, which identifies the component. This is directly related to carrier gas flow rate, temperature and column packing and dimensions. The area under each peak is proportional to the concentration of the component of the sample. The area of the peaks inscribed on the chart recorder can be determined by multiplying the height of the peak in mm, by the width of the peak in mm at 1/2 the peak height. The calibration curves for use with the chart recorder are therefore peak area plotted against concentration.'

Frits are porous metal products to prevent unwanted particles from entering the chromatography system. These particles may come from the sample, the solvent or debris generated by the chromatography system itself. Such particles entering the system may lead to clogging of capillaries, interference with the chromatography by changing chromatographic parameters or disturbance of the detector function.

  LABEL @en 'prothrombin time assay' 
  DESCRIPTION @en 'The prothrombin time is an assay most commonly measured using blood plasma. Blood is drawn into a test tube containing liquid citrate, which acts as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma. In newborns, whole blood is used. The plasma is analyzed by a biomedical scientist on an automated instrument at 37 degrees C, which takes a sample of the plasma. An excess of calcium is added (thereby reversing the effects of citrate), which enables the blood to clot again. For an accurate measurement the proportion of blood to citrate needs to be fixed; many laboratories will not perform the assay if the tube is underfilled and contains a relatively high concentration of citrate. If the tube is underfilled or overfilled with blood, the standardized dilution of 1 part anticoagulant to 9 parts whole blood is no longer valid. For the prothrombin time test the appropriate sample is the blue top tube, or sodium citrate tube, which is a liquid anticoagulant. Tissue factor (also known as factor III or thromboplastin) is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples. The prothrombin ratio is the prothrombin time for a patient, divided by the result for control plasma.'

  LABEL @en 'spectrolyse heparin antifactor-Xa assay' 
  DESCRIPTION @en 'A Spectrolyse Heparin (Xa) assay is intended for the quantitative determination of therapeutic Heparin in human plasma.

The principle inhibitor of Thrombin, Factor Xa and other coagulation serine proteases in plasma is Antithrombin III. The rate of inhibition, under normal conditions, is slow, but can be increased several thousand-fold by Heparin. This mechanism accounts for the anticoagulant effect of Heparin. Low Molecular Weight Therapeutic Heparin (LMWH) preparations appear to catalyze the reaction between Factor Xa and Antithrombin III more readily than the reaction between Thrombin and Antithrombin III while standard Heparin catalyzes both reactions equally. The Factor Xa inhibition test is the most useful test for assaying the widest variety of therapeutic Heparin preparations. In this method, when both Factor Xa and Antithrombin III are present in excess, the rate of Factor Xa inhibition is directly proportional to the Heparin concentration. The residual Factor Xa activity, measured with a Factor Xa-specific chromogenic substrate, is inversely proportional to the Heparin concentration.'

Examples of such assumptions include: traversing the ontology graph ignoring relationship types using a naive algorithm will not lead to cycles (i.e. the ontology is a DAG); every referenced term is declared in the ontology (i.e. there are no dangling clauses).

An ontology is OBO Basic if and only if it has the following characteristics:
DAG
Unidirectional
No Dangling Clauses
Fully Asserted
Fully Labeled
No equivalence axioms
Singly labeled edges
No qualifier lists
No disjointness axioms
No owl-axioms header

  DESCRIPTION @en 'A study design in which surface-bound, translationally competent ribosome complexes are used to generate a translation profile for mRNA, where mRNA may be a single molecular species, or a combination of species, including complex mixtures such as those found in the set of mRNAs isolated from a cell or tissue. One or more components of the surface-bound ribosome complex may be labeled at specific positions to permit analysis of multiple or single molecules for determination of ribosomal conformational changes and translation kinetics. Translation profiles are used as the basis for comparison of an mRNA or set of mRNA species. The translation profile can be used to determine such characteristics as kinetics of initiation, kinetic of elongation, identity of the polypeptide product, and the like. Analysis of translation profiles may be used to determine differential gene expression, optimization of mRNA sequences for expression, screening drug candidates for an effect on translation.'

In the popliteal fossa the nerve gives off branches to gastrocnemius, popliteus, soleus and plantaris muscles, an articular branch to the knee joint, and a cutaneous branch that will become the sural nerve. The sural nerve is joined by fibres from the common peroneal nerve and runs down the calf to supply the lateral side of the foot. Below the soleus muscle the nerve lies close to the tibia and supplies the tibialis posterior, the flexor digitorum longus and the flexor hallucis longus. The nerve passes into the foot running posterior to the medial malleolus. Here it is bound down by the flexor retinaculum in company with the posterior tibial artery. [WP,unvetted].'

The type of lamp is often named by the gas contained in the bulb; including neon, argon, xenon, krypton, sodium, metal halide, and mercury. The electric arc in an arc lamp consists of gas which is initially ionized by a voltage and is therefore electrically conductive. To start an arc lamp, usually a very high voltage is needed to ignite or strike the arc. This requires an electrical circuit sometimes called an igniter, which is part of a larger circuit called the ballast. The ballast supplies a suitable voltage and current to the lamp as its electrical characteristics change with temperature and time. Older cytometers may use arc lamps to irradiate particles at the interrogation point.'

  DESCRIPTION @en 'Any heritable epigenetic process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of protein function by self-perpetuating conformational conversions of normal proteins in healthy cells. This is distinct from, though mechanistically analogous to, disease states associated with prion propagation and amyloidogenesis. A single protein, if it carries a glutamine/asparagine-rich (%'prion%') domain, can sometimes stably exist in at least two distinct physical states, each associated with a different phenotype; propagation of one of these traits is achieved by a self-perpetuating change in the protein from one form to the other, mediated by conformational changes in the glutamine/asparagine-rich domain. Prion domains are both modular and transferable to other proteins, on which they can confer a heritable epigenetic alteration of function; existing bioinformatics data indicate that they are rare in non-eukarya, but common in eukarya.'

The premise behind the test is the activation of downstream reporter gene(s) by the binding of a transcription factor onto an upstream activating sequence (UAS). For two-hybrid screening, the transcription factor is split into two separate fragments, called the binding domain (BD) and activating domain (AD). The BD is the domain responsible for binding to the UAS and the AD is the domain responsible for the activation of transcription.[1][2] The Y2H is thus a protein-fragment complementation assay.'

In parallel, a library of randomized oligonucleotides representing potential TF target sequences, is cloned into a separate vector containing the selectable genes HIS3 and URA3. If the DNA-binding domain (bait) binds a potential DNA target site (prey) in vivo, it will recruit RNA polymerase to the promoter and activate transcription of the reporter genes in that clone. The two reporter genes, HIS3 and URA3, allow for positive and negative selections, respectively. At the end of the process, positive clones are sequenced and examined with motif-finding tools in order to resolve the favoured DNA target sequence'

It consists of a reagents cassette (which holds the reagent containers), a sipper manifold, pumps, valves, and debubblers. The fluidics subsystem flows the sequencing reagents across the wells of the PicoTiterPlate device, and moves the spent reagents from the PicoTiterPlate device to the waste receptacle. The optics subsystem consists of a CCD camera and a camera controller. The camera captures the light emitted in the wells of the PicoTiterPlate device during each step of the sequencing cycle, and sends the digital images to the computer subsystem for processing. The computer controls the other Sequencer subsystems, and processes the digital images sent by the camera to extract the DNA sequence information.'

The sequencing process does not requires amplification step and is typically able to produce reads of 25 base pair length. is a DNA sequencing which allows sequence identification by relying on the following steps:
1. Primers hybridize to the P1 adapter sequence within the library template.
2. A set of four fluorescently labeled di-base probes compete for ligation to the sequencing primer. Specificity of the di-base probe is achieved by interrogating every 1st and 2nd base in each ligation reaction.
3. Multiple cycles of ligation, detection and cleavage are performed with the number of cycles determining the eventual read length.
4. Following a series of ligation cycles, the extension product is removed and the template is reset with a primer complementary to the n-1 position for a second round of ligation cycles is a DNA sequencing which allows sequence identification by relying on use of DNA polymerase and reversible terminator. The methods requires immobilization of genomic DNA fragment onto a surface and a specific clonal amplification step known as bridge PCR. Reliance on reversible terminator allow cycles of DNA chain extension by DNA polymerase and imaging without the need of electrophoretic separation of newly synthesized DNA fragment as with Sanger sequencing. is a DNA sequencing which allows sequencing of a single strand of DNA by synthesizing the complementary strand along it, one base pair at a time, and detecting which base was actually added at each step. The template DNA is immobilized, and solutions of A, C, G, and T nucleotides are added and removed after the reaction, sequentially. Light is produced only when the nucleotide solution complements the first unpaired base of the template. The sequence of solutions which produce chemiluminescent signals allows the determination of the sequence of the template.

ssDNA template is hybridized to a sequencing primer and incubated with the enzymes DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase and apyrase, and with the substrates adenosine 5-prime phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin.'

scan (at what m/Q) will produce a mass spectrum, a record of ions as a
function of m/Q. An analyser is a flow_cytometer that is used to measure properties of particles (whole cells, nuclei, chromosomes, diatoms, plankton, bacteria, viruses) by moving these particles through a detection chamber. An analyser is used to collect data for analysis. A photodetector is a device used to detect and measure the intensity of radiant energy through photoelectric action. In a cytometer, photodetectors measure either the number of photons of laser light scattered on impact with a cell (for example), or the flourescence emitted by excitation of a fluorescent dye.
