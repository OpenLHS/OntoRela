# OntoRelα
## Application for generating a relational database using an ontology

OntoRelα generates from an ontology and a set of configuration files, a set of scripts that create a fully functional RDB. The method consists of two processes: the ontological analysis and the ontology conversion. The analysis process verifies the structure of the ontology and builds an appropriate internal representation of the ontology. The conversion process converts the ontology constructs into a logical model as SQL scripts that creates the RDB.
